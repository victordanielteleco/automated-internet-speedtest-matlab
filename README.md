This a small script to make automated internet test 
It uses speedtest cli from ookla, it shows you different stadistics and plots the values
you can choose to export or not to export the figures and the table with the results, also you can export a csv to make stadistics outside matlab (in for example)

The motivation behind this project is to optimize time while i was testing a wifi mesh network
